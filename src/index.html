                My name is Nathan Toups. I'm not convinced that I could (or should) try to sum myself up in a few words, but I can certainly share a bit of propaganda:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I write stuff on my blog at <a href="https://nomasters.io">nomasters.io</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I hack on <a href="https://killcord.io">killcord</a> a <strike>cyberpunk vanity project</strike> censorship resistant deadman's switch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I created <a href="http://rjrbt.io">rjrbt</a> so that clients would pay me to work on interesting problems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I keep track of the surprising number of things people have trusted me to <a href="writing-speaking-and-press.html">write, speak and get press coverage for here</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm probably not on [insert social media platform here] because <a href="https://nomasters.io/posts/nonparticipation/">I don't care to participate</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can email me at <a href="mailto:not-spam-i-promise@2p5.xyz">not-spam-i-promise@2p5.xyz</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can also find me on <a href="https://keybase.io/rjrbt">keybase</a> because what they are doing is super cool.
                </li>
            </ul>
